- ## Sokoban

Sokoban is a simple puzzle-type game which the goal is to place the crates in the marked places. The task is more difficult than it looks because of multiple boxes and the intricacy of the labyrinth the game takes place in. The complication of maps increases as you progress with levels.
Each level is unique and require a different strategy.
***

- ## Game rules
You control the bulldozer that push the boxes, with as few moves as possible place crates in the marked places, your score depend on the number of moves you make. You can only move the boxes with the front of the bulldozer (shovel), while driving the bulldozer remember that you can only move one box at the same time. There are 20 official map from us with different levels of difficulty(Easy, Medium, Hard). Good luck!
***

- ## How to play

We move the bulldozer with the <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> keys, which are used to move up (W), down (S), left (A) and right (D).
For main menu press <kbd>ESC</kbd>.


- ## Menu <br>
#### Button <kbd style="background-color: red; color:white"> Graj</kbd> 
It takes us to the place where we can choose a random level divided into difficulty: easy, medium, difficult. Here we can also select <kbd style="background-color: red; color:white">All lvls</kbd> and choose exactly which level we want play. The <kbd style="background-color: lightblue;">Editor</kbd> button takes us to the map editor where we can create our own maps and edit existing ones. To exit to the main menu, click the arrow in the upper left corner.


#### Button <kbd style="background-color: red; color:white"> Leaderboard</kbd> 
Here we can see our results from all maps. To exit to the main menu, click the arrow in the upper left corner.

#### Button <kbd style="background-color: red; color:white"> Exit</kbd> 
This button is used to quit the game, to do this we can also use <kbd> ESC</kbd> key 

- ## Preparing the game

To run the game on Windows systems, search for the file **sokoban.exe** in the build folder, similarly to Linux-based systems, then run the file **sokoban** from this folder.

- ## Building
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Adan222/sokoban
cd sokoban
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
git reset --hard 9f6aaaccb70d6f114a967f0ab83eff42840614ed
```

We are reverting to ImGui 1.81 by reseting, because on mingw new version have problem with IMM linking. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/16964

Vcpkg requires powershell. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1



### For building Linux binares
```sh
./vcpkg install sfml imgui imgui-sfml nlohmann-json nativefiledialog soloud
cd ..
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
make

```
### For cross building to Windows 
If any error occures during `cmake` command(eg. freetype missing), please try rerunning.

```sh
./vcpkg install sfml imgui imgui-sfml nlohmann-json soloud --triplet x64-mingw-static
./vcpkg install nativefiledialog --head --triplet x64-mingw-static
cd ..
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-mingw-static -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<absolute path to sokoban dir>/toolchain-mingw-x64.cmake -DVCPKG_APPLOCAL_DEPS=OFF
ln -s /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libopengl32.a /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libOpenGL32.a
make
